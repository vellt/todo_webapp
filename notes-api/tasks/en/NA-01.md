# NA-01 - Login

## As a registered user I want to login to access private services of NotesAPI

### Points: 1
### Service: [POST /user/login](http://localhost:5000/api-doc#/Users/AuthController_login)
### Priority: high

The task is to create a login page where an already registered user can log in with their email address and password.
After a successful login the token returned by the service must be saved on client side so that it can be used for other services. Redirect the user to the home page.  
If the login is unsuccessfull indicate this to the user. The site cannot send incorrect input paramaters towards the service, they must be validated on client side.  
If the page is accessed by an already logged in user redirect them to the [profile page](./NA-03.md).

#### Login data:
- Username
  - field name: username
  - type: text, request for email address
