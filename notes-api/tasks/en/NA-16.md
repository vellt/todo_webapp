# NA-16 - Done a task

## As a user I want to easily mark a task as done

### Points: 1
### Service: [PATCH /notes/{noteId}/{taskId}](http://localhost:5000/api-doc#/Note%20items/TasksController_updateNoteItem)
### Priority: low
### Prerequisites: [NA-06 - Todo lists](./NA-06.md), [NA-11 - Detailed information](./NA-11.md)

Currently the user can only mark a task as done on the detailed information page, make this functionality available on the within an easily accessible form without entering the edit mode. Add a checkbox or switch next to the task which represents the current state. The color and text strikethrough should remain.  
When the user clicks on the checkbox send a request toward the service by negating the current state. During the operation do not allow the user to click on the item again. In case off success make this visible by changing the state of the checkbox and the look and feel of the label accordingly (see [detailed information](./NA-11.md)).  
When an error occured during the operation display a coresponding notification for the user.
