# NA-15 - Mark as favorite

## As a user I want to easily mark my todo list as favorite

### Points: 1
### Service: [PATCH /notes/{noteId}](http://localhost:5000/api-doc#/Notes/NotesController_updateNote)
### Priority: low
### Prerequisites: [NA-06 - Todo lists](./NA-06.md)

When a user wants to mark a todo list as favorite they need to edit it in dedicated window. Create a way to make this functionality easily accessible with only click.  
Transform the star icon to a button. When the users clicks on the star icon send a request toward the service by negating the current state. Do not let the user click on the button while the action is in progress (e.g. disable it or display a loading indicator). The successul operation is indicated by changing the icon accordingly. In case of error display a coresponding notification for the user.

#### Example input:
`PATCH /notes/3896648c-748e-4e83-b32a-8639f3263c90`
```
{
  isFavorite: true
}
```

#### Example output
200 OK status code
```
{
  "color": "yellow",
  "isFavorite": true,
  "items": [],
  "id": "3896648c-748e-4e83-b32a-8639f3263c90",
  "title": "New TODO list",
  "creationDate": "2024-04-28T15:39:00.466Z"
}
```

#### Errors reported by the service:
- 400 Bad request - invalid input data
- 401 Unauthorized - missing or invalid bearer token
- 404 Not found - the selected todo list cannot be found
