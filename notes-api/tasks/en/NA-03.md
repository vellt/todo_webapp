# NA-03 - Profile and logout

## As a logged in user I want to access my data I gave during the registration

### Points: 1
### Service: [GET /user](http://localhost:5000/api-doc#/Users/AuthController_getProfile)
### Priority: high

The task is to indicate on the page if the user has already logged in and can access locked services or if login is required.
Display the first and last name and email address of the user and provide an opportunity to exit. Have a dedicated page for this data.  
When the user clicks on logout removed the stored token he got during [login](./NA-01.md), and services that require authorization will no longer be allowed.  
Use the Authorization header in the request to access data from the service. If an error occours log the user out and redirect to the login page.

#### Successful request
200 OK status code
```
{
  "email": "admin@local.com",
  "firstName": "Nigel",
  "lastName": "Uno",
  "userId": "c3621d67-c304-41ad-b965-907f74d46bf2"
}
```

#### Errors reported by the service:
- 401 Unauthorized - missing or invalid Bearer token
