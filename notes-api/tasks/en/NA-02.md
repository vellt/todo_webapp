# NA-02 - Registration

## As a user I want to register so that I can login to the application

### Points: 2
### Service: [POST /user](http://localhost:5000/api-doc#/Users/AuthController_register)
### Priority: high

The task is to create a registration form, request data from the user and validate them on client side. Send this data to the corresponding NotesAPI service.  
The data of the given field must be validated when the user has left the field - if the field contains an error, highlight it and display the message next to the field.
After successful registration indicate this in a pop-up window and provide an opportunity to log in. Reset the content of the registration form.  
If an error occured during the registration notify the user in a form of a message (e.g. the email is already taken by someone else).  
Two buttons should be availabe on the page:
- Cancel - always active, if the user clicks on it the original state of the form is restored (empty fields)
- Register - while the form contains incorrect data its content cannot be sent (disabled)
