# NA-08 - Create new todo list

## As a logged in user I want to create new todo lists

### Points: 2
### Service: [POST /notes](http://localhost:5000/api-doc#/Notes/NotesController_addNote)
### Priority: high

Provide a page where logged in users can create new todo lists. This item should be always visible for the users.  
When the users clicks on it display the form in pop-up window. The data provided by the user has to be validated by criteria below. Error messages for individual elements should be visible near the fields. The name of the todo list cannot be equal to an other created earlier (small- and uppercase letters are the same) - while calling the service this error is marked by 409 error code.  
After successful creation close the popup window, display a notification for the user about the result and provide a way within to display the new list. If the user is already on the main/search page the list must be updated.  
In case of error let the pop up window open and mark it in the form the cause (e.g. the given todo list already exists).  
Make it possible to close the window with a dedicated function.

#### Input parameters
