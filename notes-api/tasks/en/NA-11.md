# NA-11 - Detailed information

## As a user I want to see the detailed information of the todo list

### Points: 2
### Service: [GET /notes/{noteId}](http://localhost:5000/api-doc#/Notes/NotesController_getNote)
### Priority: high

The task is create a dedicated page where a user can see the detailed information of the selected todo list. Make it possible to edit the list itself (see criterias at [update todo lists](./NA-09.md)), create a new task (see at [new tasks](./NA-12.md)), removal ([NA-13](./NA-13.md)) or update ([NA-14](./NA-14.md)) of existing one. Make it possible to delete the todo list as well: ask for confirmation similar in [removing todo list](./NA-10.md) and after successful removal redirect the user to the home page to see his own lists.  
The page must be accessible by clicking on the link or icon on the home page within the selected todo list. The todo list must look the same as in the home page. Make the creation date (`creationDate`) visible and well formatted.  
Implementation of the mentioned other tasks are not included in the story, those are external items.
