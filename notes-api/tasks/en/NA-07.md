# NA-07 Search among notes

## As a user I want to search within my notes so that I can find the right items

### Points: 2
### Service: [GET /notes](http://localhost:5000/api-doc#/Notes/NotesController_searchNotes)
### Priority: high
### Prerquisites [NA-06 - Todo lists](./NA-06.md)

The task is to create a search functionality letting the user filter their own notes. The search can be done in free-word form or by specifying a time interval (between start and end dat), keeping the ordering of the [todo lists](./FA-06.md). The list can be narrowed according to whether it is marked as a favorite or by the specified color. With the exception of the search field these elements should be hidden, but it should be possible to reach them and the conditions already set should be visible in some form even without it.

#### Query parameters
- Free-word search:
  - param name: query
  - type: text
- Later than:
  - param name: after
  - type: date in YYYY-MM-DD format (or ISO)
- Earlyer than:
  - param name: before
  - type: date in YYYY-MM-DD format (or ISO)
- Favorites only
  - param name: favorites
  - type: boolean
  - optional: if false or not set the value is ignored
- Ordering (see [Todo lists](./FA-06.md))
  - param name: orderBy
  - type: select

#### Example request
`http://localhost:5000/notes?query=buy%20beer&orderBy=date.DESC`

#### Successful request - example
200 OK status code
